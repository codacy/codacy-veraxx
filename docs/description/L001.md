L001 No trailing whitespace
---------------------------

Trailing whitespace is any whitespace character (space or tab) that is placed at
the end of the source line, after other characters or alone.

The presence of trailing whitespace artificially influences some source code
metrics and is therefore discouraged.

As  a  special case, the trailing whitespace in the otherwise empty lines is
allowed provided that the amount of whitespace is identical to the indent in the
previous line - this exception is more friendly with less smart editors, but can
be switched off by setting non-zero value for the strict-trailing-space
parameter.
