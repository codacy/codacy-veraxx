L005 There should not be too many consecutive empty lines
---------------------------------------------------------

The empty lines (if any) help to introduce more "light" in the source code, but
they should not be overdosed in the sense that too many consecutive empty lines
make the code harder to follow.

Lines containing only whitespace are considered to be empty in this context.
