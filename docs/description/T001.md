T001 One-line comments should not have forced continuation
----------------------------------------------------------

The one-line comment is a comment that starts with `//`.

The usual intent is to let the comment continue till the end of the line, but
the preprocessing rules of the language allow to actually continue the comment
in the next line if line-splicing is forced with the backslash at the end of the
line:

```
void foo()
{
    // this comment is continued in the next line \
    exit(0);
}
```

It  is not immediately obvious what happens in this example.
Moreover, the line-splicing works only if the backslash is really the last
character in the line - which is error prone because any white characters that
might appear after the backslash will change the meaning of the program without
being visible in the code.
