T007 Semicolons should not be isolated by spaces or comments from the rest of the code
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The semicolon should not stand isolated by whitespace or comments from the rest
of the code.


```
int a ;     // bad
int b
;           // bad
int c;      // OK
```

As an exception from this rule, semicolons surrounded by spaces are allowed in
for loops:


```
for ( ; ; ) // OK as an exception
{
    // ...
}
```

**Compliance**: Inspirel
