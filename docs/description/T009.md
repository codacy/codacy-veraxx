T009 Comma should not be preceded by whitespace, but should be followed by one
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A comma, whether used as operator or in various lists, should not be preceded by
whitespace on its left side, but should be followed by whitespace on its right
side:

```
void fun(int x, int y, int z);
int a[] = {5, 6, 7};
class A : public B,
        public C
{
    // ...
};
```

An exception to this rule is allowed for operator,:

```
struct A {};
void operator,(const A &left, const A &right);
```

**Compliance**: Inspirel
