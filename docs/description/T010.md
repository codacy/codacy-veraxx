T010 Identifiers should not be composed of `l` and `O` characters only
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The characters `l` (which is lowercase `L`) and `O` (which is uppercase `o`)
should not be the only characters used in the identifier, because this would
make them visually similar to numeric literals.

**Compliance**: Inspirel
