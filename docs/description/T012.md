T012 Negation operator should not be used in its short form
-----------------------------------------------------------

The negation operator (exclamation mark) reduces readability of the code due to
its terseness.
Prefer explicit logical comparisons or alternative tokens for increased
readability:

```
if (!cond)         // error-prone
if (cond == false) // better
if (not cond)      // better (alternative keyword)
```

**Compliance**: Inspirel
