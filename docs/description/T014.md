T014 Source files should refer the Boost Software License
---------------------------------------------------------

The Boost Software License should be referenced in the source code.

This rule verifies that at least one comment in the source file contains the
"Boost Software License" phrase.

Note that this rule is very specific to the Boost libraries and those project
that choose to use the Boost license.  It is therefore not part of the default
profile.

**Compliance**: Boost
