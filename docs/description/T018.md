T018 Using namespace is not allowed in header files
---------------------------------------------------

Using namespace directives are not allowed in header files.

The using namespace directive imports names from the given namespace and when
used in a header file influences the global namespace of all the files that
directly or indirectly include this header file.

It is imaginable to use the using namespace directive in a limited scope in a
header file (for example in a template or inline function definition), but for
the sake of consistency this is also discouraged.
